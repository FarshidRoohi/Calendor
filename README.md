### Contributing
Your contributions are always welcomed but for easier and faster code review please consider:
- This project uses [gitflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow "gitflow")
	- Feature branches are created from **develop**
	- When a feature is complete it is merged into the **develop**
- Create a descriptively named branch
- Every **branch** should only fix **one** issue, this way branches can be merged easier
- Each **commit** should only change **one** thing, this way commits can be reverted easier
- When you need feedback or help, or you think the branch is ready for merging, open a pull request
- Refrrain from adding tools and technologies that **increase** the complexity of the project
